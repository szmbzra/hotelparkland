/**
 * ============================================================================
 *  SITE CONFIG — the single source of truth for Hotel Parkland's identity.
 *
 *  Three other places hold per-property values, by design:
 *    1. src/app/globals.css  → brand colours (--luxury-gold, etc.)
 *    2. src/data/data.ts     → homepage content (copy, images, arrays)
 *    3. public/img           → photography
 *
 *  No CMS is wired up yet — every page reads straight from this file and
 *  data/data.ts. If Parkland gets a headless CMS later, that's a data-layer
 *  swap behind the same functions in data/data.ts; nothing here changes.
